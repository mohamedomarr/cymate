# Comment Edit and Delete Endpoints Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of two new API endpoints for comment management as requested in the project requirements.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Edit Comment Endpoint

**Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/comments/<comment_id>/`

**Requirements Met**:
- ✅ Auth required (Token Authentication)
- ✅ Validates ownership before allowing edit
- ✅ Accepts payload: `{ "content": "updated comment text" }`
- ✅ Returns updated comment data on success

**Implementation Details**:
- Located in `blog/api.py` - `CommentViewSet.partial_update()` method
- Uses `get_comment()` helper method for ownership validation
- Returns 404 if comment not found or user doesn't own the comment
- Returns 400 if content field is missing
- Returns 200 with serialized comment data on success

### 2. Delete Comment Endpoint

**Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/comments/<comment_id>/`

**Requirements Met**:
- ✅ Auth required (Token Authentication)
- ✅ Validates ownership before deletion
- ✅ Returns 204 No Content on success

**Implementation Details**:
- Located in `blog/api.py` - `CommentViewSet.destroy()` method
- Uses same `get_comment()` helper method for ownership validation
- Returns 404 if comment not found or user doesn't own the comment
- Returns 204 No Content on successful deletion

## Code Architecture

### CommentViewSet Class

```python
class CommentViewSet(NotificationMixin, viewsets.ViewSet):
    """
    ViewSet for managing individual comments.
    Provides edit and delete functionality with ownership validation.
    """
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]
    parser_classes = (MultiPartParser, FormParser, JSONParser)
```

### Key Methods

1. **`get_comment(comment_id, user)`**: 
   - Helper method that validates comment existence and ownership
   - Returns comment object if owned by user, None otherwise

2. **`partial_update(request, pk=None)`**:
   - Handles PATCH requests for editing comments
   - Validates content field presence
   - Updates comment and returns serialized data

3. **`destroy(request, pk=None)`**:
   - Handles DELETE requests for removing comments
   - Deletes comment and returns 204 status

## URL Configuration

**Added to `blog/urls.py`**:
```python
# Comment related endpoints
path('comments/<int:pk>/', CommentViewSet.as_view({
    'patch': 'partial_update',
    'delete': 'destroy'
}), name='comment-detail'),
```

## Security Features

### Ownership Validation
- Both endpoints verify that the requesting user owns the comment
- Non-owners receive 404 errors (not 403) to prevent information disclosure
- Uses ForeignKey relationship: `comment.user == request.user`

### Authentication
- Requires valid authentication token
- Uses Django REST Framework's `IsAuthenticated` permission class
- Supports both Token and JWT authentication

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error responses for different scenarios
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Clear error messages for debugging

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:

✅ **Test 1**: Owner can edit comment (200 OK)
✅ **Test 2**: Non-owner cannot edit comment (404 Not Found)  
✅ **Test 3**: Content validation works (400 Bad Request)
✅ **Test 4**: Non-owner cannot delete comment (404 Not Found)
✅ **Test 5**: Owner can delete comment (204 No Content)
✅ **Test 6**: Deleted comment returns 404 (404 Not Found)

## API Usage Examples

### Edit Comment
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/comments/123/ \
-H "Authorization: Token YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"content":"Updated comment content"}'
```

**Response (200 OK)**:
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "user": "username",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "author": {
    "username": "username",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe"
  },
  "content": "Updated comment content",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Delete Comment
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/comments/123/ \
-H "Authorization: Token YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

**Response**: 204 No Content (empty body)

## Error Responses

### 400 Bad Request (Missing Content)
```json
{
  "error": "Comment content is required"
}
```

### 404 Not Found (Comment Not Found or Not Owned)
```json
{
  "error": "Comment not found or you do not have permission to edit this comment"
}
```

### 401 Unauthorized (No Auth Token)
```json
{
  "detail": "Authentication credentials were not provided."
}
```

## Integration with Existing System

### Compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Uses existing `CommentSerializer` for consistent response format
- Inherits from `NotificationMixin` to maintain notification behavior
- Follows same authentication pattern as other endpoints

### Database Impact
- No schema changes required
- Uses existing Comment model
- Maintains referential integrity

### Minimal Changes
- Added 1 new ViewSet class (60 lines of code)
- Added 1 URL pattern
- Updated imports in urls.py
- Updated documentation

## Constraints Satisfied

✅ **Minimal, targeted changes**: Only added necessary code for comment editing/deletion
✅ **No modification of working components**: Existing comment creation still works
✅ **System compatibility maintained**: Uses existing models, serializers, and auth
✅ **Focused solution**: Addresses only the specific comment management requirements

## Documentation Updates

- Added new section "3. Comment Management Endpoints" to README.md
- Updated API endpoint numbering throughout documentation
- Added practical usage examples with curl commands
- Documented error responses and status codes
- Added entry to "Known Issues and Solutions" section

## Files Modified

1. **`blog/api.py`**: Added `CommentViewSet` class
2. **`blog/urls.py`**: Added comment endpoints and updated imports
3. **`README.md`**: Added comprehensive documentation
4. **`COMMENT_ENDPOINTS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`**: This summary document

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully provides the requested comment edit and delete functionality with:
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Ownership validation for security
- Comprehensive error handling
- Full compatibility with existing system
- Minimal code changes
- Thorough documentation and testing

Both endpoints are now ready for production use and follow Django REST Framework best practices.
